README: Instructions for Turning In Assignments

1. A folder will be created for you in the course's google drive and shared with you.

3. Note the exercise name and number and file name requirements from the textbook.

4. Place your finished assignment in your student assignment folder, using the correct naming convention for that assignment, before the required assignment deadline.

5. Do not go back and change or save the assignment files after the deadline. If you do that, the file modification date will be updated, and the assignment will be considered late.
